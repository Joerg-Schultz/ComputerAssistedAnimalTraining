# Computer Assisted Animal Training 
## Why?

> Training is simple, but not easy <small>(<i>Bob Bailey</i>)</small>

### Make your training easier

Do you still send urgent information via a letter written with a pen on paper? Or do you rely on technologies like E-Mail or What's app? There might be the right time for the letter, but in most cases, technology allows for a faster communication leading to better results. So, why then is the standard technology used in animal training a Clicker (which was invented in 1939)? Can we use 


In the easiest case the computer will guide the handler with the precision of a professional trainer. 
In the most advanced case AI method will take over to train the dog directly.

### Make your clients training easier

## Why not?
Replacing the relationship. On the contrary. Clear communication with reward based training will improve your relationship.

## Levels

### Get suggestions while you train and protocol your training (supported training)
Mainly to get randomness in your training. E.g. suggesting the next duration or distance. See PlanTrainDoc.

### Supervise the animals behaviour (data driven decision making)
Using sensors like light gates but also AI based. 
- Automatically collect data about training to make better decisions about next training steps. Sniffing Nose Detector
- While training, inform the trainer about details of behaviour which might be hard to observe. MediGate 
- Supervise your own behaviour. PTDCam

### Train the animal (automated training)
Integration of the first two levels with feeders for fully automated training. Think real-environment skinner box. Example Dog on mat.
As you also collect data about the previous behaviors, the computer can adapt the training level.
