# Computer Assisted Animal Training 
## Why?

> Training is simple, but not easy <small>(<i>Bob Bailey</i>)</small>

### Make your training easier

Do you still send urgent information via a letter written with a pen on paper? Or do you rely on technologies like E-Mail or What's app? There might be the right time for the letter, but in most cases, technology allows for a faster communication leading to better results. So, why then is the standard technology used in animal training a Clicker (which was invented in 1939)? Can we use 


In the easiest case the computer will guide the handler with the precision of a professional trainer. 
In the most advanced case AI method will take over to train the dog directly.

### Make your clients training easier

Becoming a good animal trainer needs years of dedicated education, training, and experience. Still, in a typical scenario, we need our clients which do not have this experience (and don't want to become an animal trainer themselves in the most cases) to continue the training at home and in their daily life. With Computer Assisted Animal Training, we can make their lives easier. Computer Assisted Animal Training can:

- give detailed advice while the client trains the animal -> improve the training outcome
- progress the training level based on previous behaviours without consultation of the trainer -> fewer consultations lower the cost for the client and allow more clients for the trainer
- can protocol their training to get informed feedback from the trainer -> trainer can spot problems earlier
- train the animal without intervention by the client -> higher training rates.

Taken together, the client will see results in a shorter time-span with less work. And satisfied clients are the best advertisement for a trainer.

## Why not?
Replacing the relationship. On the contrary. Clear communication with reward based training will improve your relationship.

## Levels

### Get suggestions while you train and protocol your training (supported training)
Mainly to get randomness in your training. E.g. suggesting the next duration or distance. See PlanTrainDoc.

### Supervise the animals behaviour (data driven decision making)
Using sensors like light gates but also AI based. 
- Automatically collect data about training to make better decisions about next training steps. Sniffing Nose Detector
- While training, inform the trainer about details of behaviour which might be hard to observe. MediGate 
- Supervise your own behaviour. PTDCam

### Train the animal (automated training)
Integration of the first two levels with feeders for fully automated training. Think real-environment skinner box. Example Dog on mat.
As you also collect data about the previous behaviors, the computer can adapt the training level.
